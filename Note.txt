After changing anything to the models.py files, need to migrate the changes to the db:

python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

Sometimes db gets all f'd up.  Need to remove sqlite.db and many times the migration
files in each migration folder in booking and member sub apps.  Make sure not to
remove __init__.py files or else the models will not be recreated.

If you delete entire db, will have to create superuser/members again:
python manage.py createsuperuser --username admin --email admin@example.com
